          <p className="text-gray-600 font-light leading-7 tracking-wide">
            Every business starts with a vision. Anthony&apos;s journey began
            after successfully building and selling a previous business,
            inspiring him to create a local agency that prioritizes customer
            relationships over impersonal service.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-600 font-light leading-7 tracking-wide">
            As he transitioned from that success, a lingering thought grew into
            a compelling vision: to create an insurance company that felt more
            like a supportive friend and less like a faceless entity.

            From One Vision to the Next

            Selling his previous venture was both an end and a beginning. It
            provided a rare opportunity to reflect on what truly mattered in
            business and in life. The idea of starting You Insurance Agency
            wasn't just about entering the home and auto insurance market; it
            was about revolutionizing it. The vision is to move away from the
            impersonal experiences often associated with insurance and build a
            company that prioritized the community and personalized service.
